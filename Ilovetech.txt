What do I love about technology?

	Of course I appreciate technology for many things.  Its vastness, ease of use, availability, etc.  But none
of the aforementioned nice-ities are the reason I love technology.  I love technology because of its behavior.  Once a system or 
application is created, it "lives" its entire existance based upon its logic.  It doesn't feel, and it cannot be 'suaded to do things 
differently.  The only times it ever changes or evolves into something better than itself, is when its "mind" is changed by a programmer 
or software updates.  I admire that most about technology.  It doesn't care about feelings, or affinity, it cares about the facts of the 
matter.  That, in my opinion is the best part about technology:  The raw logic and rules affiliated to it.
